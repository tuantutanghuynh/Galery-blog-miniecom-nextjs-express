// Background cleanup for bank-transfer orders nobody paid for. Placing such an order holds stock in
// `reservedQuantity`, and without this job that counter only ever goes up: after a few weeks the
// shop would report everything sold out while the shelves are still full. The reservation mechanism
// is only half a design — this file is the other half.

// Cancels every expired order and gives its held units back, returning how many it handled so the
// caller (or a test) can see whether it did anything.
//
// Each order is claimed with a conditional UPDATE before its stock is touched. That condition is
// what makes the job safe to run twice at once: if the server ever runs as two instances, both will
// find the same expired order, but only one of them will update a row. The other sees zero rows
// affected and moves on, instead of releasing the same reservation a second time and inflating
// available stock beyond what physically exists.
//
// Orders are processed one transaction each rather than all in one. A single failing row then
// cancels only itself; batching them would mean one bad order blocks every other order's stock from
// coming back.
